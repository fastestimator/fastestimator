        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        shadow_roi: Region of the image where shadows will appear (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max).
            All values should be in range [0, 1].
        num_shadows_lower: Lower limit for the possible number of shadows. Should be in range [0, `num_shadows_upper`].
        num_shadows_upper: Lower limit for the possible number of shadows.
            Should be in range [`num_shadows_lower`, inf].
        shadow_dimension: Number of edges in the shadow polygons.
