    """Operators which apply to single images (as opposed to images + masks or images + bounding boxes).

    This is a wrapper for functionality provided by the Albumentations library:
    https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations. A useful visualization tool for many of the possible effects
    it provides is available at https://albumentations-demo.herokuapp.com.

    Args:
        func: An Albumentation function to be invoked.
        inputs: Key(s) from which to retrieve data from the data dictionary. If more than one key is provided, the
            `func` will be run in replay mode so that the exact same augmentation is applied to each value.
        outputs: Key(s) under which to write the outputs of this Op back to the data dictionary.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
