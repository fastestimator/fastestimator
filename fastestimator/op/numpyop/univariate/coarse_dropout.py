    Args:
        inputs: Key(s) of images to be modified.
        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        max_holes: Maximum number of regions to zero out.
        max_height: Maximum height of the hole.
        max_width: Maximum width of the hole.
        min_holes: Minimum number of regions to zero out. If `None`, `min_holes` is set to `max_holes`.
        min_height: Minimum height of the hole. If `None`, `min_height` is set to `max_height`.
        min_width: Minimum width of the hole. If `None`, `min_height` is set to `max_width`.
        fill_value: value for dropped pixels.
