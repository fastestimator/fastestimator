    """Zero out objects from an image + mask pair.

    An image & mask augmentation that zero out mask and image regions corresponding to randomly chosen object instance
    from mask. The mask must be single-channel image, with zero values treated as background. The image can be any
    number of channels.

    Args:
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        image_in: The key of an image to be modified.
        mask_in: The key of a mask to be modified (with the same random factors as the image).
        masks_in: The key of masks to be modified (with the same random factors as the image).
                image_out: The key to write the modified image (defaults to `image_in` if None).
        mask_out: The key to write the modified mask (defaults to `mask_in` if None).
        masks_out: The key to write the modified masks (defaults to `masks_in` if None).
        max_objects: Maximum number of labels that can be zeroed out. Can be tuple, in this case it's [min, max]
        image_fill_value: Fill value to use when filling image.
            Can be 'inpaint' to apply in-painting (works only  for 3-channel images)
        mask_fill_value: Fill value to use when filling mask.
