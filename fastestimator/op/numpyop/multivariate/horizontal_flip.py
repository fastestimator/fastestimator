    """Flip an image horizontally.

    Args:
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        image_in: The key of an image to be modified.
        mask_in: The key of a mask to be modified (with the same random factors as the image).
        masks_in: The key of masks to be modified (with the same random factors as the image).
        bbox_in: The key of a bounding box(es) to be modified (with the same random factors as the image).
        keypoints_in: The key of keypoints to be modified (with the same random factors as the image).
        image_out: The key to write the modified image (defaults to `image_in` if None).
        mask_out: The key to write the modified mask (defaults to `mask_in` if None).
        masks_out: The key to write the modified masks (defaults to `masks_in` if None).
        bbox_out: The key to write the modified bounding box(es) (defaults to `bbox_in` if None).
        keypoints_out: The key to write the modified keypoints (defaults to `keypoints_in` if None).
        bbox_params: Parameters defining the type of bounding box ('coco', 'pascal_voc', 'albumentations' or 'yolo').
        keypoint_params: Parameters defining the type of keypoints ('xy', 'yx', 'xya', 'xys', 'xyas', 'xysa').
