    """Loss class to compute mixiup and cutmix losses.

    This class should be used in conjunction with MixUpBatch and CutMixBatch to perform mix-up training, which helps to
    reduce over-fitting, stabilize GAN training, and harden against adversarial attacks. See
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412 for details.

    Args:
        loss: A loss object which we use to calculate the underlying loss of MixLoss. This should be an object of type
            fe.op.tensorop.loss.loss.LossOp.
        lam: The key of the lambda value generated by MixUpBatch or CutMixBatch.
        average_loss: Whether the final loss should be averaged or not.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided `loss` has multiple outputs.
