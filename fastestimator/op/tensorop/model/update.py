class UpdateOp(TensorOp):
    """This class performs updates to a model's weights based on the loss.

    Args:
        model: Model instance compiled by fe.build.
        loss_name: The input loss key.
        gradients: An optional key containing model gradients. These will be directly applied to the model weights
            during an update. If not provided, gradients will be computed based on the specified loss_name, which will
            automatically handle any desired mixed-precision scaling. This argument shouldn't be used if mixed-precision
            training is enabled.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        ds_id: What dataset id(s) to execute this Op in. To execute regardless of ds_id, pass None. To execute in all
            ds_ids except for a particular one, you can pass an argument like "!ds1".
        merge_grad: The gradient accumulation times before model update. Ex: if `merge_grad` = 3, for every three Op
            calls only the third one updates the model. The first two calls only accumulate its gradients. This default
            value is 1 and it will update the model at every step.
        defer: Whether to defer the actual application of the update until the end of the step. This can be necessary
            in PyTorch when trying to update multiple models which depend on one another (ex. certain GANs). By default,
            all UpdateOps which appear contiguously as the last ops of a Network will be deferred. We hope that you will
            never need to worry about this flag, but it's here for you if you need it.

    Raise:
        ValueError: When model is mixed-precision and `gradients` is provided.
        ValueError: Network framework is not one of "tf" or "torch".
        ValueError: `merge_grad` is larger than 1 in multi-GPU configuration.
        RuntimeError: If attempting to modify a PyTorch model which relied on gradients within a different PyTorch model
            which has in turn already undergone a non-deferred update.
