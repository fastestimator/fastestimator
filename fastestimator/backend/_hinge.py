    pred = tf.constant([[0.1,0.9,0.05,0.05], [0.1,-0.2,0.0,-0.7], [0.0,0.15,0.8,0.05], [1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0]])

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth class labels which should take values of 1 or -1.
        y_pred: Prediction score for each class, with a shape like y_true. dtype: float32 or float16.

    Returns:
        The hinge loss between `y_true` and `y_pred`

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `y_pred` is an unacceptable data type.
