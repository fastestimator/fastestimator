    x = fe.backend.watch(x)  # x.requires_grad == True
    ```

    Args:
        tensor: The tensor to be monitored.
        tape: A TensorFlow GradientTape which will be used to record gradients (iff using TensorFlow for the backend).

    Returns:
        The `tensor` or a copy of the `tensor` which is being tracked for gradient computations. This value is only
        needed if using PyTorch as the backend.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `tensor` is an unacceptable data type.
