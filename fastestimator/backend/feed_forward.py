    b = fe.backend.feed_forward(m, x)  # [[~0.5, ~0.5], [~0.5, ~0.5], [~0.5, ~0.5]]

    Args:
        model: A neural network to run the forward step through.
        x: An input tensor for the `model`. This value will be auto-cast to either a tf.Tensor or torch.Tensor as
            applicable for the `model`.
        training: Whether this forward step is part of training or not. This may impact the behavior of `model` layers
            such as dropout.

    Returns:
        The result of `model(x)`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `model` is an unacceptable data type.
