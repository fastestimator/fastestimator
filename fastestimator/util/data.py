class Data(ChainMap[str, Any]):
    """A class which contains prediction and batch data.

    This class is intentionally not @traceable.

    Data objects can be interacted with as if they are regular dictionaries. They are however, actually a combination of
    two dictionaries, a dictionary for trace communication and a dictionary of prediction+batch data. In general, data
    written into the trace dictionary will be logged by the system, whereas data in the pred+batch dictionary will not.
    We therefore provide helper methods to write entries into `Data` which are intended or not intended for logging.

    ```python
    d = fe.util.Data({"a":0, "b":1, "c":2})
    a = d["a"]  # 0
    d.write_with_log("d", 3)
    d.write_without_log("e", 5)
    d.write_with_log("a", 4)
    a = d["a"]  # 4
    r = d.read_logs(extra_keys={"c"})  # {"c":2, "d":3, "a":4}
