    "# Tutorial 3: Operator\n",
    "___\n",
    "In FastEstimator, the most important concept is the `Operator`, which is used extensively in `RecordWriter`, `Pipeline` and `Network`. In this tutorial, we're going to talk about everything you need to know about `Operator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a short explanation: `Operator` is a class that works like a function, it is used in FastEstimator for constructing workflow graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we all know, a python function has 3 components: input variable(s), transformation logics and output variable(s). Similarly, an `Operator` has 3 parts: input key(s), a transformation function and output key(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may think: \"`Operator` and function are almost the same, what's different between them? why do we need it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is: a function uses variables whereas `Operator` uses keys (which is a representation of variable). The purpose of `Operator` is to allow users to construct a graph when variables are not created yet. In FastEstimator, we take care of the variable creation, routing and management, so that users can have a good night of sleep!\n",
    "\n",
    "> This tutorial will first explain the concept of Operator, and then present an example of how to create and use it."
